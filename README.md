# Global-Terrorism-Analysis-on-Power-BI
I have created an informative and attractive dashboard using Power BI to visualize hot zones, main targets, most used weapons in terror attacks which took place all over the world. I have also placed a filter on the attribute year so that we can view information of a particular year.
I removed some of the columns which were not needed using power query editor.I have also created a new column named casualties(killed + wounded).
